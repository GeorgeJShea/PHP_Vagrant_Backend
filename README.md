Consult the Vagrant Documentation for the above.

Also as of Sept 28, 2022, there are all sorts of "gotchas" running Vagrant and VMware Fusion for Apple Silicon together.

##Alternatively

Create your own Ubuntu 18/20/22 Virtual Machine manuall using whatever hypervisor you wish.

Then just run all the shell commands shown in the Vagrant file on your VM

## Docker

Look at my phpcrudecruddocker repo for an example of how to containerize the app.

A ready to go app is also available on Dockhub.  Will add the pull link soon.
